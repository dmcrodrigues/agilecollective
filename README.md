Agile Collective is a wiki run by agile practioners for agile practicioners :boom:
It's aim is to serve as a go-to wiki :books: 
- for people who are interested in getting know more about agile and
- for people who already know a lot and would like to give back.

Created by @lillaluca and run by the agile community. :muscle:
